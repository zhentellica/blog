The easiest way to build a digital pastoral is to use existing social platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, or WeChat. As long as you register an account, you can take care of it regularly or irregularly. The biggest limitations of this include: insufficient personalization, mainly for single-language users, and the risk of being blocked. Don’t forget that GCSI(Guy-Can’t-Stay-Idle), who spent a few years jumping up and down, working hard to accumulate a lot of fans and those just eatting melons, but was blocked mercilessly at his critical moment.

Building a platform by yourself is indeed a technical job, requiring a lot of time and energy, but it is worth it. Excitedly, after several weeks of hard work, the first version of qWater_gMaple is finally online to meet everyone. It takes advantage of some free services provided by the open source platform GitHub, uses Jekyll, Html, CSS, JavaScript and other technologies to achieve completion, and can support switching between multiple languages.
