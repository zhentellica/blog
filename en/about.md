Wanted to have my own digital garden for a long time, where I can cultivate as much as I can, play freely, and fully enjoy the autumn scenery of the garden!

Water/Maple is such a pastoral, it is the twin of reality and the core element of a true pastoral life.

Water/Maple is a glimpse of the past, glorious and embarrassing; it is also a long-term vision of the future, with excitement and longing. It is a natural flow of thoughts; it is also a faithful record of footprints. 

Water is the soul of such pastoral, and the long flow of Clear Water will bring it to life. Maple is an idyllic style of such pastoral, and the permanent residence of Green Maple will bring it to pastoral autumn forests.
